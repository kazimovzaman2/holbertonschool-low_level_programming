# C: argc, argv

This folder contains C programs that demonstrate the usage of `argc` and `argv` parameters in the main function. In C programming, `argc` represents the number of arguments passed to the program, and `argv` is an array of strings containing the actual arguments. The programs illustrate how to parse command-line arguments, access program parameters, and perform different tasks based on the input provided via `argc` and `argv`.
