# Makefiles

This folder contains Makefiles, which are a special type of script used to automate the building and compilation of software projects. Makefiles define rules and dependencies for compiling source code files into executable programs, making it easier to manage complex projects with multiple source files. The Makefiles in this folder demonstrate how to define targets, dependencies, and commands for compiling C programs using the GNU Make tool. They showcase common Makefile conventions and best practices for organizing and maintaining software projects.
