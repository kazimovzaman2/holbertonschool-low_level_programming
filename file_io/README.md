# C: File I/O

This folder contains C programs that demonstrate file input/output (I/O) operations in C programming. File I/O operations allow programs to read data from files, write data to files, and perform various file-related tasks. The programs cover concepts such as opening, reading, writing, closing files, error handling, and working with different file modes (e.g., read, write, append). They also illustrate common file I/O operations like reading and writing text files, binary files, and random access files.
