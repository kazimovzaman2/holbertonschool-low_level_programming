# C: Bit manipulation

This folder contains C programs that focus on bit manipulation techniques in C programming. Bit manipulation involves operations on individual bits of binary numbers, allowing efficient manipulation of data at the binary level. The programs demonstrate various bitwise operations such as AND, OR, XOR, shifting, and masking. They also showcase practical applications of bit manipulation, including setting, clearing, toggling bits, and checking for bit positions.
