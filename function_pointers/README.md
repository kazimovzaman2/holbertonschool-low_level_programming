# C: Function pointer

This folder contains C programs that explore the concept of function pointers in C programming. Function pointers are pointers that point to functions instead of data variables. They allow for dynamic selection and invocation of functions at runtime, enabling powerful and flexible programming techniques such as callbacks, event handling, and dynamic dispatch. The programs demonstrate how to declare, initialize, and use function pointers in various contexts, showcasing their versatility and usefulness in C programming.
