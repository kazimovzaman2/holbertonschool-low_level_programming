# C: Functions nested loops

This folder contains C programs that demonstrate the usage of functions within nested loops in C programming. Nested loops are loops that are contained within other loops, allowing for repeated execution of code blocks in a hierarchical manner. The programs illustrate how to define functions that contain nested loops, as well as how to call these functions from within other nested loops. They showcase practical examples of using nested loops and functions together to perform complex tasks efficiently and effectively.
