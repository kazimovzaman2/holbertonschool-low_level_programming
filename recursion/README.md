# C: Recursion

This folder contains C programs that demonstrate the concept of recursion in programming. Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. The programs in this folder illustrate various examples of recursive algorithms, including factorial calculation, Fibonacci sequence generation, and binary tree traversal. They showcase how recursion can be used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, leading to elegant and concise code solutions.
