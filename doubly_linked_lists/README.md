# C: Doubly linked lists

This folder contains C programs that implement and manipulate doubly linked lists. Doubly linked lists are a type of linked list where each node contains a pointer to the previous and next nodes, enabling traversal in both directions. The programs demonstrate operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching on doubly linked lists. They also illustrate the advantages of doubly linked lists over singly linked lists, such as bidirectional traversal and efficient removal of nodes.
