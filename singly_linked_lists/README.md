# C: Singly Linked Lists

This folder contains C programs that implement and manipulate singly linked lists. Singly linked lists are a type of linked list where each node contains a single pointer to the next node in the sequence, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion operations. The programs demonstrate operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching on singly linked lists. They also illustrate common operations and techniques for working with linked lists, such as reversing the list, detecting cycles, and finding the middle node.
